# Pramamink-Shashtra
Shastras are the backbone of any religion, they contribute to ethics and values of the society. Most of the significant Shastras of Ancient Indian Civilization were destroyed by the invaders and the remaining are either too complex to understand or are misinterpreted. For preserving the Shastras and similar scriptures we will be building a system which has authentic information and verified translations them, so that majority of population which has roots cut off from Sanskrit can read and understand the pillars of our culture. Also the information will always be secured and cannot be deleted.
